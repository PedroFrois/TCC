abstract = {Java is one of the most widely used programming languages. However, Java is a verbose language, thus one of the main drawbacks of the language is that even simple tasks often entail writing a significant amount of code. In some cases, writing too much code might lead to certain code smells, which are violations of fundamental design that can negatively impact the overall quality of programs. To allow programmers to write concise code, JetBrains created a new language named Kotlin. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated whether Kotlin leads to concise and clearer code in comparison to Java. We conjecture that due to Java's verbosity, programs written in Java are likely to have more code smells than Kotlin programs. Therefore, we set out to evaluate whether some types of code smells are more common in Java programs. To this end, we carried out a large-scale empirical study involving more than 6 million lines of code from programs available in 100 repositories. We found that on average Kotlin programs have less code smells than Java programs.},

Martin (Uncle Bob) By applying universal rules of software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary software craftsman Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) reveals those rules and helps you apply them. Martins Clean Architecture doesnt merely present options. Drawing on over a half-century of experience in software environments of every imaginable type, Martin tells you what choices to make and why they are critical to your success. As youve come to expect from Uncle Bob, this book is packed with direct, no-nonsense solutions for the real challenges youll facethe ones that will make or break your projects. Learn what software architects need to achieveand core disciplines and practices for achieving it Master essential software design principles for addressing function, component separation, and data management See how programming paradigms impose discipline by restricting what developers can do Understand whats critically important and whats merely a detail Implement optimal, high-level structures for web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded applications Define appropriate boundaries and layers, and organize components and services See why designs and architectures go wrong, and how to prevent (or fix) these failures Clean Architecture is essential reading for every current or aspiring software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software managerand for every programmer who must execute someone elses designs.

abstract = {This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a “modularization” is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},
